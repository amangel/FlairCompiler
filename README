SCANNER
	The primary class for the scanner is CompilerStateScanner  It scans its input 
	on a by-character basis. It begins in a start state, and then determines if
	the following character is a valid state transition while also determining the
	type of token being created. Once an invalid state transition is detected,
	it breaks off what it has so far and attempts to make a valid token out of it
	(i.e. check if it is a valid integer, identifier, etc.).

	LexicalException is thrown for an illegal token detected in the input Flair Program.
